In this assignment, an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels is created .

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
